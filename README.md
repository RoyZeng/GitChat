#GitChat

This is the repository for GitChat, [Team Hyphen's](http://railsrumble.com/teams/team-hyphen) Rails Rumble '10 entry. GitChat provides persistent chat for GitHub repositories, designed for small-scale communication/coordination.

There is a hosted version running at [GitChat.com](http://gitchat.com), or you can host your own version. If you do, make sure to request an API key from Github at http://github.com/account/applications/new and place that information in a file called github_config.yml in the root directory.
